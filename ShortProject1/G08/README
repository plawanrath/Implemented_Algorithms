The zip file contains the following class files:

Question a: ListSets.java
Question b: LargeIntOperations.java
Question c: MergeSortLists.java
Question d: RecursionSimulation.java (Merge Sort on Lists done in Question c is implemented)  
Question f: CustomLinkedList.java

There is also, SinglyList.java which implements a custom Singly List which I use in most places, and also a Node class which contains a node of the SInglyList.

All questions coded in this project, have a main function containing some sample input and would display some sample output in console.
